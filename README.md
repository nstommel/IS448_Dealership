# IS448_Dealership
A Web GUI interface for a car dealership database management system in HTML5 with Bootstrap 4, PHP, Javascript, and SQLite3.

Included are insert, update, delete, find, and show all functions for each table. Operations are performed
asynchronously via Ajax using jQuery so the whole page does not require reloading on form submission and record display.
