# IS448_Dealership
A Web GUI interface for a car dealership database management system in HTML5 with Bootstrap 4, PHP, Javascript, and SQLite3.

Included are insert, update, delete, find, and show all functions for each table. Operations are performed
asynchronously via Ajax using jQuery so the whole page does not require reloading on form submission and record display.
SQLite3 is used as the database management system.

Please note that the index.php page is a dummy default page leading to the employee login portal. A dealership web page
here with nice pictures and content was initially planned but due to time constraints implementing the massive
DBMS GUI page functionality, it was not completed.
